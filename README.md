# Diversity-Inclusion
Hello data community !
📊As a part of the PwC Switzerland Virtual Internship Program offered by Forage, I have developed a "𝐃𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐲 & 𝐈𝐧𝐜𝐥𝐮𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧" Dashboard using Power BI. 🚀 

🔗 Dataset source : Forage, PwC Switzerland

▶𝐓𝐚𝐬𝐤 3 :
A telecom client collaborates with PwC Switzerland to enhance executive gender balance by promoting diversity and inclusion. The project entails creating key performance indicators (KPI's) for hiring, promotion, performance, and turnover, and designing a visualization to monitor and convey progress.


💠The primary aim of this analysis is to provide valuable insights into the following areas:<br/>

🗝️𝐇𝐢𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠:<br/>
By tracking the percentage of men versus women hires, we gain insight into recruitment practices, helping to ensure a balanced workforce from the start.<br/>

🗝️𝐏𝐫𝐨𝐦𝐨𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 :<br/>
Measuring the percentage of promotions between men and women helps identify and celebrate talent, ensuring opportunities are equitable and based on merit.<br/>

🗝️𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 :<br/>
Assessing average performance ratings for men versus women helps identify potential biases and establish a fair evaluation system.<br/>

🗝️𝐓𝐮𝐫𝐧𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 :<br/>
Monitoring the turnover percentage of men versus women helps identify areas of concern, ensuring the retention of diverse talent in our workplace.<br/>

The ultimate aim is to take a practical approach to tackling gender balance challenges in the workplace. The objective is not only to establish strategic goals but also to measure, analyze, and continuously enhance diversity and inclusion initiatives.<br/>

🔗The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:<br/>
• Power BI Desktop - Main data visualization platform used for report creation.<br/>
• Power Query - Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.<br/>
• DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) - Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.<br/>
• Data Modeling - Relationships established among tables to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.<br/>
• File Format - -pbix for development and -png for dashboard previews<br/>
